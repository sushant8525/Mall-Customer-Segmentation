<h2> :book:Introduction</h2>
It is essential for any businesses to understand their customers behaviour. Through that understanding, a business is able to effectively provide solutions for customers as products/services. Many businesses leverage this knowledge to gain an edge over the competition and try to come up with better offers to customers.

<h2> :book:Conclusion</h2>
  
Within the domain of Unsupervised Learning, especially in the context of Customer Segmentation, normalizing and standardizing the data will determine how the data will be plotted. Therefore it will determine how the clusters get formed. Along with the scaling methods, the modeling algorithm will affect clustering as well. Unsupervised learning finds patterns within unlabelled data.
